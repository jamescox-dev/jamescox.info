Hi,
---
I'm James, a passionate self-taught programmer.  I've been programming computers since I was eleven, when I first started out with **[BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC)** on an old **[Amstrad CPC 664](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC)**.  Since then I've learnt many more *modern* languages including: **[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)**, **[JavaScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)**, **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**, **[HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)** & **[CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/)**.

I love working on software project solving new and novel problems for business.  I'm also a keen **game developer**, and enjoy making 2D games.

I am a enthusiastic mentor, and love sharing knowledge. I have taught Game Development Clubs to primary school students, Computer Science to A-Level students, and delivered programming training to adults learners.
