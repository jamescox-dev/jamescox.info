Hi,
---
I'm James, I've been a passionate self-taught programmer ever since I wrote my first **[BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC)** program on an old **[Amstrad CPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC)**, age 11.  Since then I've learnt many more *modern* languages including: **[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)**, **[Java](https://www.java.com/)**, **[JavaScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)**, **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** (*my favourite*), **[HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)** & **[CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/)**.

I love working on software projects, solving new and novel problems for business.  I'm also a keen **game developer**, and enjoy making 2D games.

I'm a enthusiastic mentor, and love sharing knowledge. I have taught Game Development Clubs to primary school students, Computer Science to A-Level students, and delivered programming training to adults learners.
