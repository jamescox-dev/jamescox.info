This static website is self-hosted, and running on an original [Raspberry Pi Model B Rev 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Simplified_Model_B_changelog).

With only **256MB** of RAM, and a single core **700MHz** Broadcom BCM2835 ARM CPU it's quite happy serving up these page's, but can't handle much more than that...

*Please don't DoS attack my webserver is't only little* 🙏
