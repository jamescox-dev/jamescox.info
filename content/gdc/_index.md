The GameDev Club is an opportunity for primary school aged children to take a peek behind the curtain and see how the games they play are made.

We cover level, and character design using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine, and [LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/). Below is a collection of games produced at these clubs.
